**Left 4 Dead HUD**
-------------------
This is a HUD modification for the original Left 4 Dead game. This is a work in progress project and will eventually overhaul a large portion of the hud and ui elements in the game.

1. The [wiki](https://github.com/l4d/hud/wiki) has screenshots, instructions, and an update log.
2. Don't add me or message me for personal support. If you want to notify me of an issue, want to provide suggestions or feedback, create an [issue ticket](https://github.com/l4d/hud/issues).  Nothing personal, but it's better this way so everyone can see the responses.


When is the next update? How long is this project going to take? I dunno.

**Left 4 Dead HUD**
-------------------
This is a HUD modification for the original Left 4 Dead game by. This is a work in progress project and will eventually overhaul a large portion of the hud and ui elements in the game.

1. The [wiki](https://github.com/l4d/hud/wiki) has install instructions, configuration, update log, and screenshots.
2. Don't add me for personal support. If you want to notify me of an issue, have an issue, want to provide suggestions or feedback, create an [issue ticket](https://github.com/l4d/hud/issues).  Nothing personal, but it's better this way so everyone can see the responses.


When is the next update? How long is this project going to take? I dunno.
